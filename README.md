Pretty bouring right , nahh man….

NAHH LET’S MOVE ON FROM THE TOPIC
Let’s talk about beauties~

who’s your alltime ‘crush’, i said you go first. He said his was ’emma’ as long as i ask… ‘Stone’ or ‘Watson‘, he replied ‘Watson’ otherwise i could have been pinch him for the same coz mine is ‘Stone’(although watson was my damn crush back in harry potter days, where i even dreamed that she gonna be my future wife!)

He asked now who’s yours alltime…

I said i have two…‘Stone’ and ‘touka’, &now chakshu’s like.. mann u like badass mugs……. im like not exactly but they comes with that, he pinch me hard as hell for same, i said “whatt” watson is not badass at all, she’s pure intellectual lady I know, he told me freakishly: dude no one knows her better than me! (i was like….”hmm”)

Chakshu now want to know my pity party..


why didn’t you pick my calls dickhead!!
He asked who’s your girlfriend, &i don’t know why but, whenever i hear that word…. i always remembered gwen’s line to peter: “you have done this to me, again&again&again”!!

I said nah i don’t have any, “whattt” you had told me, you had one, & im like what’s the purpo of asking then, you spiltted? he asked(haha)…me: yo! ,chakshu : howw mr.gosl??

I was “dump”; what dump!.. tell me exactly bro what u did, I said that’s was the only problem ‘i did nothing’ on that ship. Isn’t that love? he added like a fucking socrates. I think it was… we both had real feelings for each other, but things went wrong & not happened what i exepected. Somehow we’ve lost touch and i became dump asusual, some side of coolness from her& some from me i lost her feeling for me, so as the relation.

so where’s she now dump boy?

I don’t know man; she’s be cool wherever she is. Did she picked up another, i don’t know man..we don’t talk anymore, Didn’t you even stalk her on platforms, even now you are social bat !

I do, i mean why not imma ‘londa’

Did you ever make it out with her & i giggled like: no man i didn’t even touched her properly, (he laughs) ohh sorry bro but you the first ‘asshole’ who didn’t make it out even after on year. He was chuckling continously & iwas thinking isn’t that the reason about her that she’s off!

I asked him now tell me about your’s, just to taunt him

& He slowly brings up’s the ‘kabir singh’ look on me, and im like oh sorry man.

Don’t you think you should try atleast one more time, for “what” i ask, for being together again; he replied, nah man i tried already, but i don’t think she want to, it’s better to be off now.

Chakshu asked again, bro i didn’t understand properly what exactly happend, i told him the full version, then he laughs after listening all my shit & he laughs same as “rorgan”, however right at that moment what i felt like i was a complete idiot.

well I think you are pretty good about girls(chuckle) , yeah man….. i’m,

What’s the lamest line you ever hit any girl , &im like every second line turns out the lamest from me……where did that question came from(bc kya puch ra h!!….mze lele tu pure.) , nahh man i just figured out something, just asking…

I thought a moment& said i was in fifth and i remember that was the birthday of class favourite crush, every one shows up with their own stuff, i go to her and said the lamest line ever(chks slowly chuckles and ask: which one) i said “Many Many roses happy birthday missgorgeous”….chakshu laugh so hard that he blasted a shitass ‘fart‘ same as scully b99.


We both were polished by the little showers, but we kept talking& moved from that stuff.

I asked him..

(Although he is 4 years older than me, but i never felt like that way ever), bro you have any ‘fantasy’? he’s like dude which fantasy(giggle), (which is a pretty usual coz you if ask any dude & we always come’s with that same mindset every time) , i said again did you have any fantasy that is unrealistic ,he looked at me like he just want to answer that question from a long time, but nobody asked him..


Bro i just want to live in a world of fucking “zombieland”.

I just want my ‘little rock’ with me &that’s it man, now i have all world to travel, i can move anywhere……, don’t you think it’ll be so cool if you are in full of zombies with the ‘little rock’( i said “wichita”), ohh yeah man, but just imagine you in the zombieland where you didn’t have your known one’s, but only ‘strangers’, you can steal anything, eat anything, ride any porcshe& all you have to do is to kill those mddafuckin zombies and survive with your mate till the end.(his eyes was shining like “watson” has just proposed him).

However he impressed me with his fant, although i already had this fant in my fant list, i said yes it’ll feel amazing man!! and i hope you’ll live this dream at midnight.

Tingling his moustache asked, what’s your’s..

Bro i don’t have any specific, i have tons of fairytails, i just asked you coz if your’s impressed me i would probably add up on my list, but i already had that, so tell me any top one so that i would do the same on my lists he asked…


Lofting my nose i said i want that most of us really want it too , i want to study literature my whole teen into that blurry ‘Hogwarts’ castle by being a “wizard“.

Chakshu chuckled like ohh man kid’s stuff , but i want to be there too , although im not teenager but i really don’t care as long as i have the chance to be in that castle with my hermione( both giggles)

Rain still rocking, and we both looked at the clouds like there were all set to play the harry potter theme song, he asked which one you like ‘Harry’ or ‘malfoy’?

I liked both but i said “Ron” just to taunt him.

Rain were slow down& partly showers were ahead…

We both turn our spikes on& ran away from the terrace to grab patties///





         Thanksforjoining the shitin the rain~</p>
